## 🛠️ **Methodology**

The application development will follow an iterative and incremental methodology, structured into seven main phases, managed through GitHub Projects for continuous monitoring, planning and task management, ensuring transparency regarding task status. The continious monitoring and strict emphasis on quality control aligns with the principles of agility, delivering value in increments. Progress will be monitored closely through periodic meetings and email communication with the tutor, who acts as the Project Manager and Technical Lead. Version control adheres strictly to the GitHub repository, where the functionalities are made in differents release branches, remaining the `main` branch stable all time, and finally integrating the changes only after a mandatory Pull Request (PR) process.

## ⚙️ **Detailed Functionalities**

The following functionalities are classified into three levels according to their relevance, complexity and impact on the system. This classification helps to clearly define the development priorities and considerations:

### 🥉 Basic 

These functionalities represents the minimum required for the application to operate correctly and provide the event browsing and ticket management experience:

- **Anonymous User** 🕵️:
    * View and explore the main list of events.
    * View and explore the main list of participants.
    * View detailed information about specific events (description, category, date, location, participants, image, reviews) and participants (description, category, image).
- **Registered User** 👤:
    * Secure user registration and authentication.
    * Proile management: personal details, image, email, purchase history, followed participants, favorites events.
    * Purchase event tickets.
    * Cancel previous purchased tickets.
- **Administrator User** 👑:
    * Perform CRUD (Add, delete, and modify) operations on Events.
    * Perform CRUD (Add, delete, and modify) operations on Participants.

### 🥈 Intermediate 

Functionalities that adds value and improves user experience:

* **Advanced Search** 🔎: 
    * Filter events by category, date, participant and other event information.
    * Search through keyword search bar.
    * Combine multiple filters to refine results.
* **Review System** ⭐:
    * **Registered User:** Add, modify, and delete their own reviews.
    * **Administrator User:** Manage and moderate user generated reviews.
* **Image Upload** 🖼️: 
    * Upload and update profile images for registered users and participants.
    * Upload event promotional posters and images.
* **Statistics Charts** 📊:
    * Bar chart displaying the number of tickets sold per event.
    * Pie chart that categorize sales based on event types.
* **Help** ❓:
    * Implementation of a help center that includes a FAQ section with common questions and issues.
* **Social Interaction** ❤️:
    * Functionality for registered users to save and manage a personalized list of favorite events.
    * Functionality for registered users to follow participants to receive upcoming events and other information.

### 🥇 Advanced 

Functionality that allows obtaining the final version of the application, which are more complex, requiring algorithmic implementation, additional technologies or external service integration:

* **Personalized Recommendation System** 🧠: 
    * Algorithm that generates personalized event feeds for each user, by analyzing user preferences based on:
        * Previously consumed genres or categories.
        * Event popularity metrics like number of tickets sold or rating.
* **Digital Ticketing (PDF)** 📄:
    * Automatic generation of tickets in PDF format after successful purchase.   
* **Email Service** 📧: 
    * Allow users to contact support through email.
    * Sends automated emails to users (purchase confirmations, reminders).
* **Geolocation** 🗺️: 
    * Use of Google Maps/OpenStreetMap for event location display.
* **Real-Time Notifications** 🔔: 
    * Implementation of WebSockets for live alerts (sold-out tickets, newly added events).
* **Simulated Resale/Transfer** 🔄: 
    * Implementation of a system to simulate tickets resales or tranfers between users.
* **Sentiment Analysis (AI Rating)** 🤖✨: 
    * Automatic processing of user reviews in events by using NLP (Natural Language Processing) to classify coments. The process works as follows:
        * Each comment receives a sentiment label (Positive, Neutral or Negative), a sentiment score (0.00-1.00) and a rating AI based on the review.
        * The interface displays and compares both user rating and AI rating for error detection and to improve the recommendation system.

### 📊 Charts

Statistical data will be shown using the following visual charts:

1. **Bar Chart:** Show the attendance count (tickets sold) per event.
2. **Pie Chart:** Show the percentage of tickets depending on the event type (e.g., talk, concert).

### 🧰 Complementary Technologies

The project will integrate the following external technologies:

1. **PDF Generation:** To create and send the tickets bought.
2.  **Geolocation:** Use of Google Maps / OpenStreetMap to geolocate and display the exact event location.
3.  **Email Service:** To send emails with information such as the purchase confirmations or reminders.
