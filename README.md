## 🧭 *Introduction*

🎟️ **GoEventsNow** is a modern and dynamic web platform designed to centralize the management and ticket sales for a wide variety of cultural, social and entertainment events, such as concerts, theatrical plays, talks, and more. The goal of this web is to offer users a unique experience to discover, explore and attend events they are interested in by purchasing tickets directly through the website.

Users can explore events using advanced search and filtering options, view complete events and participants details, and register to access other features, such as purchasing tickets, managing their profiles, writing reviews, and more. In addition, GoEventsNow includes a personalized recommendation algorithm, real-time notifications and integrations with external services like PDF ticket generation and email ticket delivery.

GoEventsNow aims to provide a complete, modern and user-centered system that simplifies the management and discovery of events, offering users a high-quality experience. To achieve this, the project is developed using Spring Boot, Angular, and AI-based sentiment analysis, prioritizing technologies studied throughout the degree. The main goals are to ensure high code quality with solid development practices, guaranteeing scalability and maintainability in relation with the expectations of a Final Degree Project.

## 🛠️ *Methodology*

> The application development will follow an iterative and incremental methodology, structured into seven main phases and managed through GitHub Projects for continuous monitoring, planning and task management, ensuring transparency regarding task status. The continuous monitoring and strict emphasis on quality control aligns with the principles of agility, delivering value in increments. Progress will be monitored through periodic meetings and email communication with the tutor, who acts as the Project Manager. Version control will be adhered strictly to the GitHub repository, where the functionalities are made in different `release` branches, remaining the `main` branch stable all time, and finally integrating the changes only after a mandatory Pull Request process.

## ⚙️ *Detailed Functionalities*

> The following functionalities are classified into three levels according to their relevance, complexity and impact on the system. This classification helps to clearly define the development priorities and considerations:

### 🥉 **Basic**

> These functionalities represent the minimum required for the application to operate correctly and provide the event browsing and ticket management experience:

- **Anonymous User** 🕵️:
    - View and explore the main list of events.
    - View and explore the main list of participants.
    - View detailed information about specific events (description, category, date, location, participants, image, reviews) and participants (description, category, image).
- **Registered User** 👤:
    - Secure user registration and authentication.
    - Explore and edit profile: personal details, image, email, purchase history, followed participants, favorites events.
    - Purchase event tickets.
    - Cancel previously purchased tickets.
- **Administrator User** 👑:
    - Add, delete, and modify operations on Events.
    - Add, delete, and modify operations on Participants.

### 🥈 **Intermediate** 

> Functionalities that adds value and improves user experience:

- **Advanced Search** 🔎: 
    - Filter events by category, date, participant and other event information.
    - Search through keyword search bar.
    - Combine multiple filters to refine results.
- **Review System** ⭐:
    - **Registered User:** Add, modify, and delete their own reviews.
    - **Administrator User:** Manage and moderate user generated reviews.
- **Image Upload** 🖼️: 
    - Upload and update profile images for registered users and participants.
    - Upload event promotional posters and images.
- **Statistics Charts** 📊:
    - Bar chart displaying the number of tickets sold per event.
    - Pie chart that categorizes sales based on event types.
- **Help** ❓:
    - Implementation of a help center that includes a FAQ section with common questions and issues.
- **Social Interaction** ❤️:
    - Functionality for registered users to save and manage a personalized list of favorite events.
    - Functionality for registered users to follow participants to receive upcoming events and other information.

### 🥇 **Advanced** 

> Functionality that allows obtaining the final version of the application, which are more complex, requiring algorithmic implementation, additional technologies or external service integration:

- **Personalized Recommendation System** 🧠: 
    - Algorithm that generates personalized event feeds for each user, by analyzing user preferences based on:
        - Previously consumed genres or categories.
        - Event popularity metrics like number of tickets sold or rating.
- **Digital Ticketing (PDF)** 📄:
    - Automatic generation of tickets in PDF format after successful purchase.   
- **Email Service** 📧: 
    - Allow users to contact support through email.
    - Sends automated emails to users (purchase confirmations, reminders).
- **Geolocation** 🗺️: 
    - Use of Google Maps/OpenStreetMap for event location display.
- **Real-Time Notifications** 🔔: 
    - Implementation of WebSocket for live alerts (sold-out tickets, newly added events).
- **Simulated Tickets Payment** 🔄: 
    - Implementation of a simulated payment gateway system to simulate a secure payment process.
- **Sentiment Analysis (AI Rating)** 🤖: 
    - Automatic processing of user reviews in events by using NLP (Natural Language Processing) to classify comments. The process works as follows:
        - Each comment receives a sentiment label (Positive, Neutral or Negative), a sentiment score (0.00-1.00) and an AI rating based on the review.
        - The interface displays and compares both user rating and AI rating for error detection and to improve the recommendation system.

## 🔍 *Analysis*

### 📱 **Screens & Navigation**

> The design of the application screens and navigation has been carried out using the design tool Figma. This decision was not only because it provides an efficient and clear environment for creating wireframes, but also because I already had previous experience using it during the degree in other projects. Each wireframe is defined along with a description of its functionality.
> 
> The goal of these wireframes is to provide a conceptual representation of the user interface without focusing on visual styling or implementation details. They define the structure, layout, and navigation flow of the main pages of the system, specifically covering the Basic and Intermediate functionalities defined. Advanced functionalities are intentionally excluded from the visual design, since they require additional technologies or depend on external services.
