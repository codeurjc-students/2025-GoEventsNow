# 🎟️ 2025-GoEventsNow-

## 🧭 **Introduction**

🎟️ **GoEventsNow** is a creative and dynamic web platform designed to centralize the management and ticket sales for a wide range of **leisure events** 🎤🎭, including concerts, theatrical plays, talks, and similar gatherings. The system enables **administrators** 🧑‍💻 to publish, categorize, and maintain a detailed catalog of events, integrating **geolocation** 🗺️ and managing capacity. For **registered users** 👤, the application offers a complete flow: from the secure purchase of **tickets** 🎟️ and the submission of **reviews** ⭐ with ratings, to instant access to their **personal history** of interactions. Inspired by the future, the platform features a sophisticated **recommendation algorithm** 🧠 based on the tickets bought by the user and external services such as integration for automatic **PDF ticket generation** 📄 or **tickets shipments by email** 📧, ensuring a complete, transparent, and user-centric ecosystem for event administration and the consumer experience. **GoEventsNow: Your Next Event, Now, Simplified.** ✨

## 🎯 **Objectives**

### 📈 Functional Objectives

The main functional objectives is to deliver a complete and creative web for the management and consumption of leisure events, making posible to users to register at the website, and discover, participate in and review different kinds of events. All of this, while administrators manage all the content and user interactions efficiently.

**List of Key Functionalities:**

| Number | Functionality | Description |
| :-: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Discovery & Search** 🔍 | Allow users to view, search and filter for events, using multiple criteria (category, date, location...). |
| **2** | **User Activity** 🔐 | Provide a secure system for user registration, login, and profile management (including purchase history or edit profile). |
| **3** | **Ticketing & History** 🎟️ | Enable the purchase of tickets for any event and provide users with a historical record of all transactions they made. |
| **4** | **Events rating** ⭐ | Implement a review and rating system so that registered users can provide feedback on the events they participate in. |
| **5** | **Content Control** ⚙️ | Provide different functionalities specifically dedicated to the administrator, in order to add, delete, and modify events or participants, and managing user-generated content. |
| **6** | **Algorithm Personalization** 🧠 | Develop a recommendation system based on user history or popularity to personalize the discovery experience. |
| **7** | **Digital Ticketing** 📄📧 | Ensure automatic generation of tickets in PDF format and their shipment via email once the user successful purchase the ticket. |
| **8** | **Graphic Reports** 📊 | Provide the user with graphics (bar and pie charts) on sales performance and attendance data for each event. |
| **9** | **Real Time Communication** 🔔 | Implement a system for real time notifications (e.g., tickets sold out, new events, purchase alerts) for users. |
| **10** | **AI Implementation** 🤖 | Implement AI functionalities. |

### 💻 Technical Objectives

The project is firmly approached using modern technologies, prioritizing tools studied during the degree (e.g., Spring Boot, Angular, MySQL). The primary objectives are to guarantee high code quality through rigorous application of good practices, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and delivering a robust user experience, aligning the implementation with the highest standards expected of an Engineering graduate.

**List of Technical Objectives:**

| Number | Technical Aspect | Description |
| :-: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Modern Technologies** 🌐 | Implementation using a recommended stack: Backend API REST in Java/Spring Boot and Frontend SPA with Angular. |
| **2** | **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)** 🚀 | Implementation of the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, ensuring automated quality control and continuous delivery. |
| **3** | **Automated Testing** 🧪 | Application of automated testing (Unit, Integration, E2E) using technologies like Java, JUnit, Selenium, and Rest Assured. |
| **4** | **Packaging & Deployment** ☁️ | Containerization of the entire application using Docker for consistent local development and deployment in Cloud platform (AWS). |
| **5** | **Data Persistence** 🗄️ | Use of MySQL as the relational database for application persistence and data management. |
| **6** | **Repository** 💾 | Use of GitHub for version control and GitHub Projects for project tracking and transparency |
| **7** | **External Service Integration** 🛰️ | Integrate complementary technologies like PDF generation and geolocation (e.g., Google Maps/OpenStreetMap). |
| **8** | **Security** 🛡️ | Ensure a strong role permission system (Anonymous, Registered, Admin) to protect functionalities and sensitive data. |
| **9** | **Code Quality Analysis** 🔍 | Integration of SonarQube for automated static code analysis, resolving possible code violations. |
| **10** | **Real-Time Communication** 🔔 | Implementation of WebSockets for delivering real-time notifications (e.g., ticket updates, event changes). |

## 🛠️ **Methodology**

The application development will follow an iterative and incremental methodology, structured into seven main phases, managed through GitHub Projects for continuous monitoring, planning and task management, ensuring transparency regarding task status. The continious monitoring and strict emphasis on quality control aligns with the principles of agility, delivering value in increments. Progress will be monitored closely through periodic meetings and email communication with the tutor, who acts as the Project Manager and Technical Lead. Version control adheres strictly to the GitHub repository, where the functionalities are made in differents release branches, remaining the `main` branch stable all time, and finally integrating the changes only after a mandatory Pull Request (PR) process.
