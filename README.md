## 🔍 **Analysis**


### 📱 Screens & Navigation

The design of the application's screens and navigation has been carried out using the design tool Figma. This decision was not only because it provides a efficient and clear environment for creating wireframes, but also because I already had previous experience using it during the degree in other projects. Each wireframe is defined along with a description of its functionality and the elements it contains.

The goal of these wireframes is to provide a conceptual representation of the user interface without focusing on visual styling or implementation details. They define the structure, layout, and navigation flow of the main pages of the system, specifically covering the Basic and Intermediate functionalities defined. Advanced functionalities are intentionally excluded from the visual design, since they require additional technologies or depend on external services.
