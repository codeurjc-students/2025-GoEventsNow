## 🧭 *Introduction*

🎟️ **GoEventsNow** is a modern and dynamic web platform designed to centralize the management and ticket sales for a wide variety of cultural, social and entertainment events, such as concerts, theatrical plays, talks, and more. The goal of this web is to offer users a unique experience to discover, explore and attend events they are interested in by purchasing tickets directly through the website.

Users can explore events using advanced search and filtering options, view complete events and participants details, and register to access other features, such as purchasing tickets, managing their profiles, writing reviews, and more. In addition, GoEventsNow includes a personalized recommendation algorithm, real-time notifications and integrations with external services like PDF ticket generation and email ticket delivery.

GoEventsNow aims to provide a complete, modern and user-centered system that simplifies the management and discovery of events, offering users a high-quality experience. To achieve this, the project is developed using Spring Boot, Angular, and AI-based sentiment analysis, prioritizing technologies studied throughout the degree. The main goals are to ensure high code quality with solid development practices, guaranteeing scalability and maintainability in relation with the expectations of a Final Degree Project.
