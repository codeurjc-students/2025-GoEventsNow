> The application development will follow an iterative and incremental methodology, structured into seven main phases and managed through GitHub Projects for continuous monitoring, planning and task management, ensuring transparency regarding task status. The continuous monitoring and strict emphasis on quality control aligns with the principles of agility, delivering value in increments. Progress will be monitored through periodic meetings and email communication with the tutor, who acts as the Project Manager. Version control will be adhered strictly to the GitHub repository, where the functionalities are made in different `release` branches, remaining the `main` branch stable all time, and finally integrating the changes only after a mandatory Pull Request process.
