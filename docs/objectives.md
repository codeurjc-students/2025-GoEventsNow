### 📈 **Functional Objectives**

> The goal of the application is to deliver a complete and creative web for managing and discovering events, making it possible for users to register, explore, participate in and review a wide variety of events. Users will be able to manage their tickets, add events to their favorites list, follow participants and interact with additional features that make their experience in the web unique and enjoyable.

| Number | Functionality | Description |
| :-: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Discovery & Search** 🔍 | Users can view, search and filter events using multiple criteria such as category, date and location. |
| **2** | **User Activity** 🔐 | Provides a secure system for user registration, login, and profile management (including purchase history and profile editing). |
| **3** | **Ticketing & History** 🎟️ | Registered users can securely purchase tickets through the payment gateway and access to their historical record of all their transactions. |
| **4** | **Events rating** ⭐ | Registered users can rate and review the events they attend, providing feedback for other users. |
| **5** | **Content Control** ⚙️ | Administrators can add, delete and modify events or participants. |
| **6** | **Algorithm Personalization** 🧠 | Implements a recommendation system based on user history and event popularity to personalize event discovery. |
| **7** | **Digital Ticketing** 📄📧 | Tickets can be downloaded in PDF format and sent via email once the purchase is successfully completed. |
| **8** | **Chart Reports** 📊 | Users can visualize events statistics based on sales performance and attendance data for each event (Bar and Pie charts). |
| **9** | **Real-Time Communication** 🔔 | Users will receive real-time notifications (tickets sold out, purchase alerts). |
| **10** | **AI Sentiment Analysis** 🤖 | Users reviews will be analyzed using an AI sentiment analysis system, generating rating suggestions and classifying comments to improve recommendations. |

### 💻 **Technical Objectives**

> The project will be a full-stack application, using the modern technologies studied during the degree, such as Spring Boot, Angular or MySQL. The goal is to guarantee high code quality through the application of good practices, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and delivering a unique user experience, aligning the implementation with the highest standards expected of an Engineering graduate.

| Number | Technical Aspect | Description |
| :-: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Modern Technologies** 🌐 | Implementation using the recommended stack: Backend API REST using Spring Boot and Frontend SPA using Angular. |
| **2** | **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)** 🚀 | Implementation of the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, ensuring automated quality control and continuous delivery. |
| **3** | **Automated Testing** 🧪 | Application of automated testing (Unit, Integration, E2E) using technologies like Java, JUnit, Selenium, and Rest Assured. |
| **4** | **Packaging & Deployment** ☁️ | Containerization of the entire application using Docker for consistent local development and deployment in Cloud platform (AWS). |
| **5** | **Data Persistence** 🗄️ | Use of MySQL as the relational database for application persistence and data management. |
| **6** | **Repository** 💾 | Use of GitHub for version control and GitHub Projects for project tracking and transparency |
| **7** | **External Service Integration** 🛰️ | Integrate complementary technologies like PDF generation and geolocation (Google Maps/OpenStreetMap). |
| **8** | **AI Integration (NLP)** 🤖 | Integration of a NLP microservice, implemented with open-source models, responsible for multilingual sentiment analysis of user reviews. |
| **9** | **Code Quality Analysis** 🔍 | Integration of SonarQube for automated static code analysis, resolving possible code violations. |
| **10** | **Real-Time Communication** 🔔 | Implementation of WebSocket for delivering real-time notifications such as tickets and events updates. |
